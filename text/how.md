To determine each teams Level Wages rank we take that teams current points total and their annual wage bill*. Each of these is normalised and weighted to allow us to combine them into a final score for each club which we use to create a new ranking. The weighting determines the degree to which teams with lower wage bills are favoured.

As it stands we weight performance and wage bills equally in the calculation. As the season progresses we hope to add features which allow users to adjust the ranking scheme themselves.

\*  We use the most recent available wage bills, those for 2017-18 season. When new data becomes available -- we expect 2018-19 data around March 2020 -- we'll use this in our model. Whilst we'd love to use more up-to-date information we feel that as clubs wage bills relative to one another tend not to vary much older data is an acceptable proxy for the time being, it's just a bit of fun âš½
