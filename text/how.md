To determine each teams Level Wage rank we take that teams current points total and their annual wage bill. Each of these is normalised and weighted to allow us to combine them into a final score for each club which we use to create a new ranking. The weighting determines the degree to which teams with lower wage bills are favoured.

As it stands we weight performance and wage bills equally in the calculation. As the season progresses we hope to add features which allow users to adjust the ranking scheme themselves.
