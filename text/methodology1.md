## Methodology

To determine each team’s Level Wages rank [After the flood](https://www.aftertheflood.com) take that team’s current points total and their annual wage bill*. Each of these is normalised and weighted to allow us to combine them into a final score for each club which we use to create a new ranking. The weighting determines the degree to which teams with lower wage bills are favoured.
